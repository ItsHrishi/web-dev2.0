<!-- Note: Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a
<title> tag could be written as <title>, <TITLE>, <Title>, <TiTlE>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice
to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability. -->

<!-- Note: In HTML, there is no requirement to add a / at the end of a void element's tag, for example: <img
src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat" />. However, it is also a valid syntax, and you may do this when you want your HTML
to be valid XML. -->

<!-- note: To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use character references. -->

<!-- note : Note: Accessing the innerHTML of elements from JavaScript will keep all the whitespace intact. This may return
unexpected results if the whitespace is trimmed by the browser. -->

<!-- Note: If your site uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance its security, the policy applies to the favicon. If
you encounter problems with the favicon not loading, verify that the Content-Security-Policy header's img-src directive
is not preventing access to it. -->

<!-- Note: The <script> element may look like a void element, but it's not, and so needs a closing tag. 
Instead of pointing to an external script file, you can also choose to put your script inside the <script> element. -->

<!-- Note: In order to improve speed, it's a good idea to set the iframe's src attribute with JavaScript after the main
    content is done with loading. This makes your page usable sooner and decreases your official page load time (an
    important SEO metric.) -->

    <!-- Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the
    <meta> element. Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata

    <meta> elements that can be included in your page's

    <h2>Emphasis example</h2>
    <p>On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of <em>goths</em> were spotted stealing
        <strong><em>several</em>
            garden gnomes</strong> from a shopping center in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all wearing
        <em>green jumpsuits</em> and <em>silly hats</em>, and seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone has
        <strong>any</strong> information about this incident, <mark>please contact</mark> the police
        <strong>now</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- HTML5 redefined <b>, <i>, and <u> with new, somewhat confusing, semantic roles. -->

    <!-- Here's the best rule you can remember: It's only appropriate to use <b>, <i>, or <u> to convey a meaning
    traditionally conveyed with bold, italics, or underline when there isn't a more suitable
    element; and there usually is. Consider whether <strong>, <em>, <mark>, or <span> might be more
    appropriate. -->

    <!-- note:
    Note: People strongly associate underlining with hyperlinks. Therefore, on the web, it's best to only underline links.
    Use the <u> element when it's semantically appropriate, but consider using CSS to change the default underline to
    something more appropriate on the web. The example below illustrates how it can be done. -->

    <h2>character reference</h2>

    <p>Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&amp;), and ends with a semicolon (;).</p>
